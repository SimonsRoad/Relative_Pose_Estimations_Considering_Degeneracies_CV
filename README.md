# Relative_Pose_Estimations_Considering_Degeneracies_CV
This repo including functions and dataset for testing traditional and our novel method in estimating camera relative pose.
For the real image data, we have managed to obtain point feature correspondence by typical SIFT algorithm and get the camera calibrated. 
Results (matches and K matrix) can be used directly to test the relative pose estimating algorithms.
The functions are written in Matlab (R2015 or later) for windows.
